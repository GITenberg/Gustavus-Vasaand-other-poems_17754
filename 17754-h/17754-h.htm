<p>It would be a sufficient reason for sanctioning this work with your
Ladyship's name, that it is an offering of gratitude, presented because
there is nothing worthier to give.</p>

<p>But there is another cause. He who celebrates a patriot, cannot address
himself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> any one more properly than to the daughter of a patriot; of
one who was for years the naval sun of England, and from whom the young
and enterprising caught the unextinguishable rays of patriotism and
courage.</p>

<p>For actions and glory such as his, the female mind is not formed; but in
the calm and active virtues of private life, which are almost equally
honourable to the possessor, your Ladyship maintains the dignity of your
race. I call to witness those whom you have soothed in affliction, and
those whom you have honoured with your friendship. They will vindicate
me from the charge of flattery, and support my assertion, that your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
patronage is as glorious to me, as any I could possibly have chosen.</p>

<p>With the hope, that the virtues of your excellent daughter, and your
son, whom I am proud to call my friend, may answer your fullest
expectations,</p>

<p>
I remain,<br />

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>As the author of these Poems is only seventeen, some apology may be
required for offering them to the public.</p>

<p>Many precedents may be quoted in favour of early publication; and the
practice perhaps is not in itself blameable, except when the advice of
good judges is unasked, or the work itself uncorrected and negligent. To
neither of these charges is the author liable. These poems, as well as
the design of publishing them, have been approved of by many sincere and
judicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> friends; and the work has been altered in many parts, in
conformity to the advice of the same persons. The author has made no
improper sacrifice to the Muse: he has deserted no duty, and neglected
no necessary employment. Influenced by these motives, he appears before
the bar of criticism, not indeed without diffidence, but unconscious of
having deserved censure. If his verses are bad, he is content to sink
into oblivion; and if the public confirms the favourable judgment of his
friends, he does not deny that it will give him real satisfaction.&mdash;He
is sensible, that if he delayed till time had matured his judgment, and
reflection perfected his ideas, the "<i>scribendi caco&euml;thes</i>," perhaps an
unfortunate inclination, would take a firm and unalterable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> possession
of his mind. He is therefore determined to try the public opinion; that
he may be enabled either to pursue his poetical studies under their
encouragement, or to desist in time from an useless employment. This
volume is not intended to challenge approbation, but to be the precursor
of something which may challenge it in future: it is not an attempt to
gain the prize, but a specimen of his powers, which may entitle him to
the honour of standing candidate for that prize. The reader will here
find the genuine effusions of a youthful fancy, free, yet not
uncontrolled; a collection of pieces, exempt from negligence and
inaccuracy, though not from the usual and inevitable faults of early
compositions. To offer less than this would be arrogant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> and to require
more than this would be unreasonable.</p>

<p>"Gustavus Vasa" was originally planned (the reader will smile) at eleven
years of age. When the author began to know what poetry was, his first
design was to write an epic poem&mdash;no matter of what sort or character,
so it was an epic poem. The subject was soon chosen; and the progress of
the work was various: sometimes hurried on with all the ardour of hope
and enterprize, sometimes relinquished for more lively pursuits, and
left to sleep for months in the leaves of a portfolio. In this manner
were six long cantos completed. At length the author, in his thirteenth
year, perceived numerous faults and extrava<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>gances in his early
composition. He destroyed the manuscript: and some time after
recommenced his poem on a new and more rational plan. Accordingly, the
first and part of the second book, were written in 1810, and the rest of
the work which is published in this volume, principally in 1812. All
that is yet completed of this production (except the sequel of the
fourth book, and the whole fifth, which are yet uncorrected) is here
presented to the public; and on its success the continuation of
"Gustavus Vasa" depends.</p>

<p>It was designed to embrace the whole actions of the hero, from his first
signalizing himself under Steen Sture, to his death in 1560; but as all
this could not be regularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> related without destroying the unity of the
poem, it was thought most convenient to begin with his introduction
among the Dalecarlians at Mora, and conclude with his first election to
the royalty, in 1523; the rest being introduced by means of narration,
anticipation, and episode.</p>

<p>It will be doubtless objected, that the enterprize is beyond his powers,
and that he acted rashly in undertaking it. But this is no light scheme;
no work, begun for want of other amusement, and deserted when a more
specious or pleasing subject for poetry presented itself. He has
considered it seriously; the subject appears full of poetical
capabilities, and superior to many others which offered themselves; and
if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> opinion of the world coincides with his own in this point, he
has resolved to make it the favourite employment of his maturer years,
and to reduce it as far as possible to perfection. Part of his plan for
continuing the poem, will be found in the Notes.</p>

<p>The smaller pieces are selected from a large number of original
compositions; they are not chosen as his favourites, but as what he
esteems most faultless. This appeared the safer method; since it is
impossible that "the flimsy productions of a youth of seventeen," as
Kirke White expresses it, should be free from considerable errors; and
we are apt to think our most irregular flights, our most vigorous ones.
On these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> pieces, however, he places little stress; his principal
reliance is on "Gustavus Vasa." The Latin Poems have been honoured by
the approbation of different Masters at Eton.</p>

<p>The Author may be accused of arrogance in saying too much of himself.
But he felt strongly that early publication, and the design of writing a
long epic poem, would naturally be censured by many well-meaning
persons; he thought it his duty to state his motives; and was less
solicitous to avoid the possible charge of self-conceit, than the
certain one of folly and presumption.</p>

<p>Any resemblance to former writers, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> may occur in the course of the
work, are generally unintentional. Thus the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Touch'd the abyss, and, lest his eyes might view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abandon'd shore, into its depths withdrew,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were written before the author had seen Persius's description of a
totally abandoned man:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;nescit quid perdat, et, alto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demersus, summ&acirc; rursus non bullit in und&acirc;.<br /></span>
</div></div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The Author has to express his sincere gratitude for a numerous and
respectable list of Subscribers. It is far beyond his expectations; and
it encourages his hope, that the reception of the present volume will
authorize his continuing in the same pursuit.</i></p>

<span class="i0">Thro' winding sophistry's protracted maze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The complicated, deep, immense design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That works in darkness like a labouring mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown to all, 'till, bursting into birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wide explosion shakes th' astonish'd earth.<br /></span>

<p><i>Ernestus enters Dalecarlia&mdash;View of the scene round Mora&mdash;Transition to
Gustavus Vasa, who it represented as reclining under a tree near his
friend, the pastor's house, and retracing past events in his mind&mdash;His
soliloquy&mdash;After briefly recounting the late disasters of Sweden, and
the arguments which induced him to resolve to quit his country, he
concludes with a prayer&mdash;Ernestus then appears, and delivers his message
from the Genius of Sweden&mdash;Gustavus treats his mission as a fiction,
upbraids him as a traitor, and attempts his life, but is prevented by
apparent prodigies, which, however, do not entirely convince him or
alter his resolution.</i></p>

<h2>NOTES ON <i>GUSTAVUS VASA</i>.</h2>


<p>I have prefixed to this fragment the title of Epic Poem, though epic
poems are growing out of fashion; because, in the structure, plan, and
metre, the heroic model is followed. My authorities for facts, dates,
and characters, are Vertot and Puffendorff. The latter I have only read
in an English translation, dated 1702: the former I quote from a small
Amsterdam edition, printed for Stephen Roger, in 2 vols. 1722.</p>

<p>Many have attributed the efforts which Gustavus made use of to deliver
his country, to ambition, and a desire of reigning. Yet, since his
elevation produced much good to Sweden, and no evil, it is surely
allowable, if not just, to attribute them to a purer motive: at any
rate, a poet is at liberty to set his hero's character in the fairest
light he can, consistently with history.</p>

<p>Steen Sture, Poetic&egrave; Stenon, was the son of Suante Sture, administrator
of Sweden, who reduced John the Second of Denmark to conclude a treaty
with him, and who is greatly extolled by historians for the
extraordinary spirit, skill, and moderation, with which he governed a
turbulent kingdom for many years. Sture, though a young man, was
admitted his successor, being duly elected on the 21st of July, 1513,
after a violent struggle with his competitor, Eric Trolle, the senator,
which laid the foundation of the enmity between him and Gustavus Trolle,
the famous Primate of Sweden. On that prelate's arrival from Rome,
however, he welcomed him to his see, and behaved to him in the most
courteous manner. This behaviour was repaid by Trolle with almost open
hostility; but the young administrator had spirit enough to resist his
encroachments. Arcemboldi, the Pope's Legate, and merchant of
indulgences, when passing through Sweden, in execution of his gainful
office, was well received by Sture, who encouraged him in his exactions,
from a political motive, and even exempted him from the duty which
former venders of indulgences had been accustomed to pay to the Kings
and Governors of Sweden. In the war commenced by Christiern the Second
against Sweden, he signalized his courage and military talents on many
occasions, and was killed in an engagement with Otho Crumpein's army,
near Bogesund in East Gothland.</p>

<p>Inferior to his father as an Administrator, he appears to have equalled
him only in courage and the art of war. He was one of those men who are
born to adorn, though not defend, a declining state: and, in the words
of the French writer, was "fitter to command a party, than govern an
empire." His death happened in the beginning of 1519.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash; ruthless Christiern &mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Christiern the Second was perhaps the worst king that ever disgraced the
Danish throne. It is difficult to find any thing estimable or admirable
in his character; he had neither the moderation of a Pisistratus, the
talents of a C&aelig;sar, nor the political prudence of an Augustus. He
succeeded his father John in 1512, and declared war against Sweden, in
which he was assisted by Trolle. Having made a descent on the coast, he
was repulsed by Steen Sture, and reduced to extremities. Wishing to
treat with Sture, he demanded hostages for his safety; some of the
principal nobles were sent to him in that quality, and among them
Gustavus Vasa. With these he immediately sailed away, and on his return,
confined them in the castle of Copenhagen, excepting Gustavus, who was
committed to the custody of Eric Banner. He made a second attack upon
Sweden, and, after the death of Steen Sture, was crowned King of Sweden.
Under false pretences, he put to death the whole Swedish senate, and
exercised innumerable barbarities on the townsmen and peasants.
(Puffendorff, passim.) Being afterwards expelled from Denmark by his
uncle Prince Frederick, and from Sweden by Gustavus Vasa, after many
fruitless attempts to regain possession of either kingdom, he was at
last seized by Frederick, August 2, 1532, and confined in the Castle of
Coldinger, where he died some years after.</p>

<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash; Upsal's haughty Prelate &mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gustavus Trolle, son of Eric the rival of Steen Sture, was sent when
young to Rome (where it is supposed he learned the art of political
finesse), and was there consecrated Archbishop of Upsal by Leo the
Tenth. On his return to Sweden, he treated with great haughtiness Steen
Sture, who came to congratulate him on his elevation. He joined in
Christiern's attempts on Sweden, and, being convicted of treason by the
assembled Swedish States, retired from his archiepiscopal throne to a
monastery. On the successes of Christiern, however, he quitted his
retirement, and, regardless of his oaths of abdication, resumed his
former office. His forcible deposition was one of the pretexts for the
massacre of Stockholm. He opposed Gustavus Vasa in his patriotic
endeavours, and once circumvented the hero with a troop of Danes, so
that he narrowly escaped with his life. Vasa, however, soon retorted the
same stratagem on his enemy; and he was at last obliged to retire into
Denmark, where he with difficulty escaped death from the resentment of
his master. A wound, received in an engagement with the troops of
Christiern the Third, terminated the existence of one of the most
restless caballers, and most accomplished statesmen, of his time.</p>

<p>Otho Crumpein, one of the most celebrated generals of the North, was

signal victories over the Danes; and afterwards, by his master's orders,
invested Stockholm. He was at length removed to Denmark by the tyrant,
who was jealous of his talents.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Brask, Bishop of Lincoping, was secretly a partisan of Christiern's, and
escaped the massacre of Stockholm by an artful contrivance. When the
order for Trolle's arrest was signed by the Senate and Bishops, at the
instigation of Steen Sture, he added his name to the rest, but secretly
slipped under the seal a note, declaring his dissent: of this he
informed Christiern, when under the edge of the axe. On Gustavus's
insurrection, he at first remained neutral: afterwards, being besieged
in his castle by Gustavus, he came over to him. But his invincible
obstinacy and factious disposition were a great obstacle to Gustavus in
the introduction of Lutheranism into his kingdom.</p>

<span class="i0">Theodore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Theodore, Archbishop of Lunden, is thus characterized by Vertot:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"L'Archev&ecirc;que de Lunden avoit beaucoup de part dans sa confiance.
C'&eacute;toit un homme de basse naissance, sans &eacute;rudition, et m&ecirc;me sans
habilet&eacute;; mais savant dans l'art d'inventer de nouveaux plaisirs,
et qui en connoissoit &eacute;galement tous les s&eacute;cr&egrave;ts et les
assaisonnemens. Il &eacute;toit redevable de sa faveur et de son &eacute;levation
&agrave; Sigebritte (the well-known mistress of Christiern): elle l'avoit
d'abord introduit &agrave; la cour pour lui servir d'espion: il passa
ensuite tout d'un coup (here we must suspect some exaggeration),
par le cr&eacute;dit de cette femme, de la fonction de Barbier du Prince &agrave;
la dignit&eacute; d'Archev&ecirc;que, et il se maintint dans sa faveur en
presentant &agrave; Christierne des plaisirs qu'il savoit accommoder &agrave; son
go&ucirc;t." P. 108, 109, Amst. ed.</p></div>

<p>Christiern, having first employed Theodore in an official commission,
appointed him Administrator of Sweden in his absence. On the news of the
Swedish rebellion, that prelate, fearful of losing the ample
opportunities he now possessed of indulging his voluptuousness and
rapacity, sent an immediate express to his master, who ordered him to
assemble his army, and attack the insurgents. In conformity to these
orders, he occupied an advantageous post on the banks of the river
Brunebec: Gustavus was on the opposite side, and he intended to dispute
the passage with him. But, through natural cowardice, or a sudden fit of
alarm, he quitted his station, like Hector; and flying for safety from
one fortress to another, was at last obliged, like Trolle, to take
refuge in Denmark.</p>

<p>While Christiern was exercising his cruelty towards the Swedes, the

<p>Gustavus was disturbed during the first years of his reign, by the

when he died (Sept. 29), the kingdom enjoyed a profound peace. The same

Christiern, was employed by him on many occasions, during the war with
Steen Sture. It was by his intercession that Christina, the widow of
that Governor, was saved from death. According to Vertot, he wished to
marry her, and, by the means of her influence and his master's
unpopularity, procure himself elected Administrator. He also concealed
many Swedish gentlemen from the rage of Christiern. He defeated the
generals of Gustavus in their first attempt upon Stockholm, and
afterwards routed one of that hero's armies in Finland. But his fleet
was at last burnt by the Lubeckers, under the command of Gustavus, and
he was compelled to retire to Gothland, where he purposed to erect an
independent kingdom of his own. This design being defeated, he continued
to harass Gustavus and the Lubeckers in various ways, 'till they at
length expelled him from Sweden. He now collected his remaining forces,
and retreated to Narva, where he was seized and imprisoned by the
Russians. After remaining some time in confinement, he was at length
released at the instance of Charles the Fifth of Germany, in whose
service he died, at the siege of Florence. According to Puffendorff, his
death happened in 1539.</p>

<p>Gustaf Wase, or Gustavus Vasa, was the son of Eric Vasa, governor of
Halland, and was cousin-german to Steen Sture. Being the grand nephew of
King Canutson, he was descended from the ancient kings of Sweden. Before
his confinement by Christiern, he was one of the moving springs of the
state; he assisted Sture with his counsels, which were bold and
judicious, and gained a signal victory over the Danes. Christiern,
receiving him as a hostage, caused him to be arrested and carried him to
Denmark, where, by the request of Eric Banner, he was entrusted to the
care of that nobleman. From his custody, however, he soon escaped, and
traversed the various provinces of Sweden, in hopes of exciting at least
some of them to assert their independence. His efforts, however,
surprising and unwearied as they were, did not avail, 'till he arrived
in the remote province of Dalecarlia. His unexpected appearance there
among the peasants excited the whole province to revolt, and an army,
assembled in haste, stormed the Governor's castle, and destroyed the
greater part of the garrison. After this beginning, his successes
gradually increased, and Angermanland, Helsingland, Gestricia, and other
governments almost immediately came over to his party. He sustained a
war against the whole powers of Christiern for some years in a most
skilful and indefatigable manner, and succeeded at last in expelling
Christiern, Trolle, and Norbi, from the land of which he was now elected
monarch. A task, scarcely less difficult, remained&mdash;to extirpate the
Catholic religion from Sweden. This he effected, and established
Lutheranism on so firm a basis, that it has resisted all attempts to
shake it. After a long and really glorious reign, he was succeeded by
his son Eric the Fourteenth, in 1560. In him were combined all the
qualities necessary to constitute a hero; he was enterprising, vigilant,
proof against pleasures, brave, prudent, and generous. He erected Sweden
to a degree of power and respectability unknown before, and laid the
foundation for the victories of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles the
Twelfth. For the particular events of his life and reign, see Vertot,
Puffendorff, the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, and most modern histories.</p>

<p>The Massacre of Stockholm, as it is commonly called, happened on the 8th
of November, 1520. Of this almost unparalleled act of baseness and
cruelty, Vertot (p. 113, 114, 115, Amst. ed.) gives the following
account, from Zigler, who was an eye-witness, and many other authors of
credit. The pretext for this execution was the demolishing of Stecka, a
castle belonging to the traitor Trolle, which the Swedish States had
ordered to be rased, contrary to the bull of Leo the Tenth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Le nouveau Roi fit ensuite inviter tout ces Seigneurs &agrave; une f&ecirc;te
magnifique qu'il fit dans le ch&acirc;teau, pour marquer la joie de son
av&egrave;nement a la couronne. Le S&eacute;nat en corps, et ce qu'il y avoit de
Seigneurs de la premi&egrave;re noblesse, &agrave; Stocolme, ne manqu&egrave;rent pas de
s'y rendre: ce ne fut pendant les deux premiers jours que festins,
que jeux, que plaisirs; Christierne affectoit des mani&egrave;res pleines
de bont&eacute; et de familiarit&eacute;; il sembloit qu'on e&ucirc;t enseveli dans la
bonne ch&egrave;re la haine et l'aversion que les deux parties avoient
fait paro&icirc;tre si long-tems l'une contre l'autre; tout le monde
s'abandonnoit tranquillement &agrave; la joie, lors que, le troisi&egrave;me
jour, les Su&eacute;dois furent tir&eacute;s de cet exc&egrave;s de securit&eacute;, d'une
maniere bien funeste."</p></div>

<p>He then proceeds to relate the proceedings of the Danish Monarch against
the Nobility, in the way of accusation, by means of his ministers the
Danish Bishops, and the Pope's Bull; and having described their pleas,
&amp;c. thus continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ce Prince sortit ensuite de l'Assembl&eacute;e, comme s'il cut voulu
laisser la libert&eacute; aux commissaires de d&eacute;lib&eacute;rer: mais en m&ecirc;me tems
on vit entrer une troupe de soldats de ses gardes, qui arr&ecirc;toient
la veuve de l'Administrateur (Christina), les Senateurs, les
Ev&ecirc;ques m&ecirc;me, et tout ce qui se trouva de Seigneurs et de
Gentilshommes Su&eacute;dois dans le ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>"Les Ev&ecirc;ques Danois, commissaires du Pape, commenc&egrave;rent &agrave; instruire
leur proc&egrave;s comme &agrave; des h&eacute;retiques, et comme s'ils eussent &ecirc;t&eacute; en
pays d'inquisition; mais la procedure &eacute;tant trop longue pour des
gens qui &eacute;toient d&eacute;j&agrave; condamn&eacute;s, Christierne, dans la crainte qu'il
ne se f&icirc;t quelque revolte en leur faveur, leur envoya des bourreaux
sans autre formalit&eacute;, pour leur annoncer qu'il falloit mourir.</p>

<p>"Le huiti&egrave;me de Novembre fut destin&eacute; pour leur supplice; on
entendit d&egrave;s le matin des trompettes et des h&eacute;rauts de la part du
Prince, qui d&eacute;fendoient &agrave; qui que ce f&ucirc;t de sortir de la ville,
sous peine de la vie: toute la garrison &eacute;toit sous les armes: il y
avoit des corps de garde aux portes, et dans toutes les places. Le
canon pr&ecirc;t &agrave; tirer &eacute;toit dans la grande place, la bouche tourn&eacute;e
contre les principals rues; tout le monde &eacute;toit dans une profonde
consternation; ou ne savoit &agrave; quoi aboutiroient ces mouvemens
extraordinaires, lorsque sur le midi ou vit ouvrir les portes du
ch&acirc;teau, et, au travers de deux files de soldats, des illustres
prisonniers, la plupart encore avec les marques de leur dignit&eacute;,
conduits &agrave; la mort par des bourreaux.</p>

<p>"Si-t&ocirc;t qu'ils furent arriv&eacute;s au lieu de leur supplice, un officier
Danois l&ucirc;t tout haut la bulle du pape, comme l'arr&ecirc;t de leur
condemnation, et il ajouta que dans le ch&acirc;timent des coupables, le
Roi ne faisoit rien que par l'ordonnance des commissaires
apostoliques, et que suivant le conseil de l'Archev&egrave;que d'Upsal.
Les Ev&ecirc;ques condamn&eacute;s, et les autres prisonniers, demand&egrave;rent avec
instance des confesseurs; mais Christierne leur refusa cette
consolation avec beaucoup d'inhumanit&eacute;, soit que ce Prince trouv&acirc;t
un rafinement de vengeance &agrave; &eacute;tendre son ressentiment sur les
choses de l'autre vie, o&ugrave; qu'il ne voul&ucirc;t pas qu'on trait&acirc;t en
Catholiques des gens qu'on venoit de condamner comme h&eacute;retiques: il
sacrifia par la m&ecirc;me politique ses amis et ses partisans, pour
n'&ecirc;tre pas soup&ccedil;onn&eacute; d'avoir fait p&eacute;rir ses ennemis: toute l'ardeur
et tout le z&ecirc;le que les Ev&ecirc;ques de Stregnez et de Scara avoient
fait paro&icirc;tre pour ses inter&ecirc;ts, ne purent les exempter de la mort,
la qualit&eacute; de S&eacute;nateurs leur co&ucirc;ta la vie, et la signature qu'ils
avoient mise &agrave; la condamnation de l'Archev&ecirc;que avec les autres
S&eacute;nateurs, fut la pr&eacute;texte de leur supplice."</p></div>

<p>(He mentions here the stratagem of Bishop Brask, related in a former
note.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On ex&eacute;cuta ensuite" (i.e. after the execution of the Bishops)
"tous les Senateurs seculiers: on commen&ccedil;a par Eric Vasa, p&egrave;re de

quatre-vingt quatorze Senateurs, qui avoient &eacute;t&eacute; arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s dans le

<p>"Le Roi n'apprit qu'avec un violent chagrin qu'on n'avoit p&ucirc; faire
p&eacute;rir quelques Seigneurs qu'il avoit proscrits particuli&egrave;rement, et
qu'on croyoit qu'ils &eacute;toient cach&eacute;s dans la ville. La crainte
qu'ils n'&eacute;chappassent, et l'esp&eacute;rance de d&eacute;courrir la r&eacute;traite de
Gustave, qu'il soup&ccedil;onnoit d'&ecirc;tre cach&eacute; dans Stocolme, lui fit
confondre les innocens avec les coupables. Il abandonna la ville &agrave;
la fureur de ses troupes: les soldats se jett&egrave;rent d'abord sur le
peuple qui &eacute;toit accoura &agrave; ce triste spectacle: ils frappoient et
ils tuoient indifferemment tous ceux qui &eacute;toient assez malheureux
pour se rencoutrer &agrave; leur chemin: ils pass&egrave;rent ensuite dans les
meilleurs maisons de la ville, sous pr&eacute;texte de chercher Gustave et
les autres proscrits; ils poignardoient les bourgeois jusque dans
les bras de leur femmes; les maisons furent mises au pillage, et la
pudicit&eacute; des femmes et des filles expos&eacute;e &agrave; la brutalit&eacute; des
soldats. Rien ne fut &eacute;pargu&eacute; que la laideur et la pauvret&eacute;: tout le
reste devint la proie du soldat furieux, qui, sous les ordres et &agrave;
l'exemple de son souverain, se faisoit un m&eacute;rite de sa fureur et de
son emportement."</p></div>

<p>Gustavus appeared in a public assembly of the Sudermanian Peasants, and

<h2>
PLAN<br />
FOR THE<br />
<i>SEVEN NEXT BOOKS</i><br />
OF<br />
GUSTAVUS VASA.
</h2>


<h4>BOOK THE FOURTH.</h4>

<p>The Supreme Being commands the Genius of Sweden to lull the Danish
garrison of Dalecarlia into false security, to invigorate the drooping
spirits of the Dalecarlians, and to assist and increase the army of
Prince Frederic of Denmark by means of various rumours, &amp;c.&mdash;The Genius
dispatches a fiend to execute the first commission, while he hastens to
perform the second.&mdash;Transition to Gustavus.&mdash;He finds his sword, but
misses Ernestus, by means of a storm which the whirlwind had
excited.&mdash;His reflections.&mdash;Taking shelter under the roof of a cottage;
he there overhears a party of young men, with Adolphus at their head,
exclaiming against the dilatory measures of the seniors, and resolving
on more vigorous plans.&mdash;He joins them, without disclosing himself, and
bids them report to the council, that a stranger will appear in the
public assembly of Dalecarlia, the following day, and notify things
which may influence their counsels.&mdash;He retires: Adolphus follows him
unseen.&mdash;The youths, returning to the assembly, find their elders
watching the event of an augury, mentioned in the Third Book.&mdash;Its
process described&mdash;the result.&mdash;The young men announce their
message.&mdash;Reflections of the Dalecarlians on it.&mdash;Gustavus meets
Ernestus, and prepares to attack him, but is prevented by a miraculous
sign.&mdash;The Genius of Sweden, after having revived the spirits of the
Dalecarlians, passes to Denmark, where he influences the Danes to join
the standards of Prince Frederic of Oldenburg.&mdash;Description of that
Prince's court, and of the state of Denmark.&mdash;The Genius returns through
Sweden.&mdash;Account of what was passing there.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE FIFTH.</h4>

<p>The Genius arrives at Mora.&mdash;Gustavus is convinced of the truth.&mdash;His
reflections on the occasion.&mdash;He concludes a friendship with
Ernestus.&mdash;He meets Adolphus, whom he recognizes as one of his former
soldiers, and whom he dispatches to the Danish fortress, to observe the
motions of the enemy.&mdash;They return to the house of the Priest of Mora,
under whose protection Gustavus then remained, and relate the recent
events.&mdash;The Curate's reply.&mdash;They retire to rest.</p>

<p>The Dalecarlian convention described.&mdash;Their proceedings prior to the
arrival of Gustavus among them.&mdash;He announces himself in the
morning.&mdash;Their joy.&mdash;The augury miraculously fulfilled.&mdash;Gustavus takes
measures to prevent the treacherous designs of some of the Dalecarlian
tribes.&mdash;He is saluted king and general by the whole assembly.&mdash;They
request him to relate his adventures.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE SIXTH.</h4>

<p>Gustavus recounts the causes of the war, and its progress, prior to the
capitulation of Stockholm; which will afford much room for detail. This
narration is necessary, to acquaint the reader with what happened before
the commencement of the action, and is therefore similar in design to
the second and third &AElig;neid, and the four narrative books of the Odyssey.
Christiern, Steen Sture, Archbishop Trolle, Otho, Norbi, and other
distinguished characters, will make a figure in this relation. The hero
describes the massacre of Stockholm, from the account of an eye-witness
of that catastrophe.&mdash;He enlarges on the death of his father Eric. Some
reflections on this event may be introduced, in imitation of
Lucan.&mdash;Fate of Gustavus's wife and sister; whose death, and the
intercession made by Christiern with Gustavus for their preservation,
will afterwards form one of the principal episodes.&mdash;He then relates
part of his numerous adventures in the different provinces of Sweden.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE SEVENTH.</h4>

<p>He continues his recital, and concludes with his arrival in Dalecarlia,
and adventures there. He then exhorts them to assist in his patriotic
design. (See his speech in Vertot.) The Dalecarlians applaud his
harangue, which is also attended by favourable omens. A body-guard of
400 men is appointed him; Adolphus is chosen captain, having now
returned, and disclosed the supineness and neglect of the Danish
garrison. Gustavus declares his intentions of storming the castle;
arranges the troops, and bids all be ready by midnight. They retire.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE EIGHTH.</h4>

<p>The proceedings of Christiern, Trolle, and Norbi, from the conclusion of
Book 4, severally described.&mdash;Gustavus secretly dismisses the unfaithful
tribes.&mdash;The Genius of Sweden appears to him in a dream; foretels his
future exaltation, and the disgraceful end of Christiern and his party.
He then shews him the reward of patriots in heaven.&mdash;Ancient Swedish
kings and heroes.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE NINTH.</h4>

<p>He now shews him, "in a sort of Pisgah-sight," as Pope expresses it, but
on a new plan, the future history of Sweden: its wars, arts, manners,
&amp;c.&mdash;Gustavus Adolphus.&mdash;Christina.&mdash;Charles the Twelfth.&mdash;Puffendorff,
Oxenstiern, Linn&aelig;us, &amp;c.&mdash;Part of the Danish history may be mentioned,
as connected with that of Sweden.&mdash;Gustavas the Fourth.&mdash;Siege of
Copenhagen by the English.&mdash;Bernadotte.&mdash;The Genius concludes with an
exhortation, and directions for prosecuting the war.&mdash;Gustavus's
prayer.&mdash;The army described.&mdash;Their leaders.</p>


<h4>BOOK THE TENTH.</h4>

<p>Parting of the Dalecarlians with their kindred: briefly delineated, like
the scene in the 5th Lusiad. Some episode may naturally be here
introduced.&mdash;The Genius blows his angelic trumpet, as a prelude to the
war: its effects.&mdash;The army of Gustavus, increased on its way by new
multitudes, reaches the castle at midnight.&mdash;Negligence of the
guard.&mdash;Gustavus, Ernestus, and Adolphus, signalize themselves. Valour
of the Governor.&mdash;The fort is stormed.&mdash;General slaughter of the Danes
by the incensed Dalecarlians.&mdash;Clemency of Gustavus to the Governor,
and all he could save from the fury of his soldiers.&mdash;The tribes who had
adhered to Christiern, send intelligence to Stockholm of the
revolt.&mdash;Trolle, in the absence of Christiern, calls a council.</p>

<p>The action, from the council in Book 1, to the taking of the castle, in
Book 10, occupies four days.</p>

<p>The remaining books, ten or fourteen in number, will be occupied with a
detail of the long and various war waged by Gustavus against Christiern,
and the poem will conclude with his coronation. Many events afford great
scope for poetry; such as the hero's constancy under his defeat by
Trolle, his subsequent victory over that prelate, the adventures of
Steen Sture's widow, the death of Gustavus's mother and sister, the
burning of Norbi's fleet, the coronation of Gustavus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>An intelligent person suggested to the author, that to compose a new
version of Homer, in the style and measure of Scott's Marmion, would be
a feasible idea. He observed, that Scott's style, and his circumstantial
descriptions, bore much resemblance to those of Homer and that the
rapid flow of Scott's verse was happily accommodated to the swift
succession of events, and fiery impetuosity of the Iliad; corresponding
with the dactylic hexameter of the old poet. These hints induced the
author to attempt the above translation.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
